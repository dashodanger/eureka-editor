<h1>Editing Modes</h1>
<p>There are four main editing modes in Eureka: Vertices, Linedefs, Sectors and Things.  These correspond to the four basic mapping concepts of DOOM levels.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Each mode has its own panel on the right side of Eureka's main window.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The 3D view acts somewhat like a different mode, but it is not a true, separate mode like the others.  For example, you can select a sector in Sectors mode, enable the 3D view, and then change some stuff in the Sectors panel and the changes will be reflected immediately in the 3D view.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Some keyboard commands can only be used in a specific editing mode.  So the same key may be bound to different functions in different modes.  For example, the <span class='key'>w</span> key will flip linedefs in Linedefs mode, spin things in Things mode, and is used for WASD movement in the 3D view.
