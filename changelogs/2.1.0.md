# CHANGES IN Eureka 2.1.0

(Since version 2.0.2)

## User interface

* Now on macOS key bindings preferences, show 'CTRL' instead of 'META' for the control key.
* Fixed the wrong user manual link from the Help menu.

## Organizing

* Now on Linux the user settings and cache are stored XDG compliant (in `~/.config/eureka` and
`~/.cache/eureka`), instead of haphazardly in `~/.eureka`.

## Backend

* Upgraded bundled FLTK to 1.3.9 for macOS and Windows (Linux FLTK is part of distro).

## Documentation

* Added contributors to AUTHORS.md
