===============

dd.mm.yyyy

* Added Dehacked resource support, by contribution of Isaac Col√≥n (https://github.com/iccolon818).

----------
20.04.2024
* Testing map now opens the game without blocking Eureka, just like user would start another app.
  Also, for macOS you can now use the app bundle.
* Deleted Makefile.xming.

----------
07.10.2023
* Now dragging lines or sectors can also split other lines. Currently still no support for the

* Added tutti-frutti texture check
* Fixed Heretic torches looking wrong in the 3D mode
* Fixed Heretic multiplayer sprite color translation

----------
24.10.2022
* Thing definition sprite lookup is now smarter and doesn't need full names for certain frames (e.g.
  BOSA1C1). In consequence, mods which change the rotation distributions won't be affected.

----------
12.10.2022
* Fixed the EUREKA lump to store relative paths so that the user settings are portable between
  computers.

----------
09.10.2021

  and should not be used for new maps when UDMF is available.

  special.
